# Embeddings & Vector Stores

> **Authors**: Anant Nawalgaria, Xiaoqi Ren and Charles Sugnet

## Introduction

Modern machine learning thrives on diverse dataâ€”images, text, audio, and more. This whitepaper explores the power of embeddings, which transform this heterogeneous data into a unified vector representation for seamless use in various applications. We'll guide you through:

* **Understanding Embeddings**: Why they are essential for handling multimodal data and their diverse applications.
* **Embedding Techniques**: Methods and models for mapping different data types into a common vector space.
* **Evaluating Embeddings**: Methods for evaluating the quality of embeddings in downstream applications.
* **Vector Databases**: Specialized systems for managing and querying embeddings, including practical considerations for production deployment.
* **Real-World Applications**: Concrete examples of how embeddings and vector databases are combined with large language models (LLMs) to solve real-world problems.

Throughout the whitepaper, code snippets provide hands-on illustrations of key concepts.
