## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for tackling complex challenges in numerous domains. While early iterations focused on general-purpose tasks, recent developments have highlighted the potential of fine-tuning LLMs to address specific problems within specialized fields. This whitepaper explores these concepts in two distinct domains: cybersecurity and medicine. Each showcases the unique ability of LLMs to enhance existing workflows and unlock new possibilities. Cybersecurity presents a number of unique challenges for LLMs, including a scarcity of publicly available data, a wide diversity of highly technical concepts, and information about threats that change on a daily basis. Additionally, sensitive use cases, like malware analysis, necessitate specific considerations for model development. We address these challenges by focusing on cybersecurity-specific content and tasks, pairing security-focused language models with a suite of supporting techniques to offer improved performance for vital tasks like threat identification and risk analysis.

In the field of medicine, LLMs face a different set of obstacles, such as the vast and ever-evolving nature of medical knowledge and the need to apply said knowledge in a context-dependent manner that makes accurate diagnosis and treatment a continual challenge.

LLMs like Med-PaLM, customized for medical applications, demonstrate the ability to answer complex medical questions and provide insightful interpretations of medical data, showing potential for supporting both clinicians and patients. Through the lens of these two distinct domains, in this whitepaper we will explore the challenges and opportunities presented by specialized data, technical language, and sensitive use cases. By examining the unique paths taken by SecLM and Med-PaLM, we provide insights into the potential of LLMs to revolutionize various areas of expertise.
