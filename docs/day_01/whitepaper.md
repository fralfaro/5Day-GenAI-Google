## Introduction

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a seismic shift in the world of artificial intelligence. Their ability to process, generate, and understand user intent is fundamentally changing the way we interact with information and technology.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a seismic shift in the world of artificial intelligence. Their ability to process, generate, and understand user intent is fundamentally changing the way we interact with information and technology. An LLM is an advanced artificial intelligence system that specializes in processing, understanding, and generating human-like text. These systems are typically implemented as a deep neural network and are trained on massive amounts of text data. This allows them to learn the intricate patterns of language, giving them the ability to perform a variety of tasks, like machine translation, creative text generation, question answering, text summarization, and many more reasoning and language oriented tasks. This whitepaper dives into the timeline of the various architectures and approaches building up to the large language models and the architectures being used at the time of publication. It also discusses fine- We believe that this new crop of tuning techniques to customize an LLM to a certain domain or task, methods to make the training more efficient, as well as methods to accelerate inference. These are then followed by various applications and code examples.
